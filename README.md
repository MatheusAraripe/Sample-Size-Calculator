# Sample-Size-Calculator
This repository was created during one of my projects at [Fiocruz](https://portal.fiocruz.br/) . To create the [mouse randomization app](https://www.google.com/search?q=tradutor) I had to perform some statistical calculation for the sample size of rats needed. 
Due to my great difficulty in finding python codes for sample size calculatio I decided to write my own algorithms for the binomail and ANOVA test.

Many statistical surveys are incorrect because of the use of wrong tests to calculate a sample or the complete lack of them. So, with this repository, I hope to contribute a little bit to improve the quality of the statistics part of the surveys.

# Binomail test
The test is used in cases of qualitative analysis and when the number of groups used is equal to two.

# ANOVA test
The test is used in cases of quantitative analysis and when the number of groups used is greater than two.
